Data Structures and algorithms in c# . I have recently  added arrays , trees and problems related to DSA .

#problem 1 (Distinct Integer)
 Problem:- This is problem is about finding no of distinct element in an intarray 
 =>I have solved this problem by 2 ways one by using array which is costly and other using hashset .
 It is easier to solve using hashset . since , it stores only distinct elements.
 
 #problem 2(Round to 1)
 Problem :- This problem is about rounding a integer to 1 and u need to return minimum steps required ie. say a number 10 you need reduce it to 1 by
             ->subtracting  1
             ->divding with 2  if possible
             ->dividing with 3 if possible
